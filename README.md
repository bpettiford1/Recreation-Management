# Recreation-Management
A website project for recreation management

USER STORIES --
As a recreation program participant,
I want to explore detailed information about recreation services, view images of activities, and contact the organization easily,
So that I can decide whether to participate in programs that suit my needs and connect with the organization if I have questions.

I can access the homepage and navigate to the About, Gallery, and Contact pages easily.
